# Algorithms

My personal notes on algorithms. I started working through the [Algorithms] course
provided by Khan Academy in partnership with Dartmouth, however it primarily
focuses on theory and does not provide real world examples. I switched to
Udacity's [CS-215][2] and the rest continues from there. There will be files
included for each algorithm I develop.

#### What are the two most important aspects of an algorithm?

1. Correctness
2. Efficiency

Typically you have to chose one over the other.
