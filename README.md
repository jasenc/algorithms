# Algorithms

My personal notes on algorithms as I work through the [Algorithms] course
provided by Khan Academy in partnership with Dartmouth. There will be files
included for each algorithm I develop.

You may notice I am doing this project in Ruby, admittedly an odd decision
considering it's inefficiencies. I have my reasons, feel free to ask.

#### What are the two most important aspects of an algorithm?

1. Correctness
2. Efficiency

Typically you have to chose one over the other.
