# Algorithms

My personal notes on algorithms. There will be files included for different algorithms, most likely written in Ruby or JavaScript.

#### What are the two most important aspects of an algorithm?

1. Correctness
2. Efficiency

Typically you have to chose one over the other.

#### How are algorithms measured?

Asymptotic Analysis.
